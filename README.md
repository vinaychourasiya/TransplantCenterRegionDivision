# TransplantCenterRegionDivision
This is my course project of IE-709 (IEOR for Healthcare)

1. Consider all the approved transplant centre in India 
2. divide the all-district of India to nearest transplants centre with the objective as follows 
    (i) Minimize the total travel distance 
    (ii) Minimize the organ wastage within one region.    (the transplant centre forms the region, and it's allocated districts)

3. Integer programming model proposes that the solution gives the optimal location for the new transplant centre within the existing system.

4. Following are the results of the model. Figure-1 shows the region allocation to particular TC. And The Figure-2 shows the new optimal TC location given all existing TC.
